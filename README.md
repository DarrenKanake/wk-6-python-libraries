Ubuntu Image Fetcher 

The Ubuntu Image Fetcher is a Python program that fetches images from the web and saves them in a specified directory. It handles multiple URLs, skips non-image links, and automatically renames duplicate files to prevent overwriting. The program uses the requests library with proper error handling for network issues, ensures directories are created as needed, and provides a summary of successful and failed downloads. Clear comments make the code easy to read, and print messages reflect Ubuntuâ€™s principles of community and respect by emphasizing mindful, responsible sharing of resources.
